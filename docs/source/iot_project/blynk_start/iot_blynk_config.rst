#. Here you are told which IDE you need to prepare, we recommend the **Arduino IDE**.

#. Here is the library you need to add, but the recommended library here is a bit problematic, we need to add other libraries manually (we will mention it later). Click **Next** here, and a new template and device will be created.

#. The next steps are to upload the relevant code and connect your board to Blynk, but since there is a problem with the library provided earlier, you need to add other libraries again. So click **Cancel** here to stop **Quick Start**.
