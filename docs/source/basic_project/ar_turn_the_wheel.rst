1.3 Motor
============================

A motor is a typical digital output device, and it is used in the same way as an LED.
However, the motor needs to be driven with a large current, and the large current may damage the main control board such as R3 board.
Therefore, an L9110 module is used in this occasion, which is a good helper for the R3 board to control the motor safely.

**Required Components**

In this project, we need the following components. 

It's definitely convenient to buy a whole kit, here's the link:
