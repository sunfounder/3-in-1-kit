4. Analog Read
======================

The Arduino can read the connected analog sensors through the analog pins.

The R3 board contains a multi-channel, 10-bit analog-to-digital converter. This means it maps the input voltage between 0 and the operating voltage (5V or 3.3V) to an integer value between 0 and 1023.

You need the ``analogRead(pin)`` function to read the value of the analog pin.

* ``analogRead(pin)``: Read the value from the specified analog pin.

   **Syntax**
      analogRead(pin)

   **Parameters**
        * ``pin``: the name of the analog input pin to read from (A0 to A5).

   **Returns**
      0-1023. Data type: int.


**Example of Analog Read**

.. code-block:: arduino

   int analogPin = A0; // device connected to analog pin A0
                     // outside leads to ground and +5V
   int val = 0;  // variable to store the value read

   void setup() {
      Serial.begin(9600);           //  setup serial
   }

   void loop() {
      val = analogRead(analogPin);  // read the input pin
      Serial.println(val);          // debug value
   }


**Notes and Warnings**

* The analog pins are A0-A5.
* You don't need to call ``pinMode()`` before calling the analog pin, but if the pin was previously set to ``OUTPUT``, the function ``analogRead()`` will not work properly, in which case you need to call ``pinMode()`` to set it back to ``INTPUT``.
