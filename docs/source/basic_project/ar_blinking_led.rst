1.1 Hello, LED! 
=======================================

Just as printing ‚ÄúHello, world!‚Äù is the first step in learning to program, using a program to drive an LED is the traditional introduction to learning physical programming.

**Required Components**

In this project, we need the following components. 

It's definitely convenient to buy a whole kit, here's the link:

**Schematic**

.. image:: img/circuit_1.1_led.png

The principle of this circuit is simple and the current direction is shown in the figure. When pin 9 outputs high level(5V), the LED will light up after the 1kohm current limiting resistor. When pin 9 outputs low level (0v), the LED will turn off.

**Wiring**

.. note::

   * You can open the file ``1.1.hello_led.ino`` under the path of ``3in1-kit\learning_project\1.1.hello_led``. 
   * Or copy this code into **Arduino IDE**.

After the code is uploaded successfully, you will see the LED blinking.

**How it works?**

Here, we connect the LED to the digital pin 9, so we need to declare an int variable called ledpin at the beginning of the program and assign a value of 9.

.. code-block:: arduino

    const int ledPin = 9;


Now, initialize the pin in the ``setup()`` function, where you need to initialize the pin to ``OUTPUT`` mode.

.. code-block:: arduino

    void setup() {
        pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
    }

In ``loop()``, ``digitalWrite()`` is used to provide 5V high level signal for ledpin, which will cause voltage difference between LED pins and light LED up.

.. code-block:: arduino

    digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);

If the level signal is changed to LOW, the ledPin‚Äôs signal will be returned to 0 V to turn LED off.

.. code-block:: arduino

    digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);


An interval between on and off is required to allow people to see the change, 
so we use a ``delay(1000)`` code to let the controller do nothing for 1000 ms.

.. code-block:: arduino

    delay(1000);
