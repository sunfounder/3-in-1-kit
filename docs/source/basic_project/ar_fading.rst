2.1 Fading
=================

This project is similar to :ref:`ar_blink` , the difference is the signal type.
The former is to make the LED light on or off by outputting a digital signal (0&1), this project is to control the brightness of the LED by outputting an analog signal.

**Required Components**

In this project, we need the following components. 

It's definitely convenient to buy a whole kit, here's the link:
