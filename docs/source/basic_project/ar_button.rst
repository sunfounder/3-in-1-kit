3.1 Reading Button Value
==============================================


In the previous projects, we used the output function, in this chapter we will use the input function to input read the button value.

**Required Components**

In this project, we need the following components. 

It's definitely convenient to buy a whole kit, here's the link:

**Schematic**

.. image:: img/circuit_3.1_button.png

One side of the button pin is connected to 5V, 
and the other side pin is connected to pin 2, 
so when the button is pressed, 
pin 2 will be high. However, 
when the button is not pressed, 
pin 2 is in a suspended state and may be high or low. 
In order to get a stable low level when the button is not pressed, 
pin 2 needs to be reconnected to GND through a 10K pull-down resistor.

.. note::

   * You can open the file ``3.1.read_button_value.ino`` under the path of ``3in1-kit\learning_project\3.1.read_button_value``. 
   * Or copy this code into **Arduino IDE**.
