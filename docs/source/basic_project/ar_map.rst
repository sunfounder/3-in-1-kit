5.6 Map
===================

If you observe carefully, you will notice that many values have different ranges in programming.
For example, the range of values for analog inputs is (0~1023).
The value range for the analog output is (0~255).
The output angle of the servo is (0~180).

This means that if we want to use the potentiometer to control the brightness of the LED or the angle of the servo, we need to go through a mapping operation.

Now let's see how to achieve it.

**Required Components**

In this project, we need the following components. 

It's definitely convenient to buy a whole kit, here's the link:

.. note::

    * Open the ``5.6.map.ino`` file under the path of ``3in1-kit\learning_project\5.6.map``.
    * Or copy this code into **Arduino IDE**.

After the code is uploaded successfully, you can rotate the potentiometer back and forth, and the output shaft of the servo will rotate back and forth.

**How it works?**

``map(value, fromLow, fromHigh, toLow, toHigh)``: Map a number from one range to another.
That is, a fromLow value is mapped to toLow, and a fromHigh value is mapped to toHigh.

    **Syntax**
        map(value, fromLow, fromHigh, toLow, toHigh)

    **Parameters**
        * ``value``: the number to map.
        * ``fromLow``: the lower bound of the valueâ€™s current range.
        * ``fromHigh``: the upper bound of the valueâ€™s curr+ent range.
        * ``toLow``: the lower bound of the valueâ€™s target range.
        * ``toHigh``: the upper bound of the valueâ€™s target range.

If the potentiometer controls the LED, you can also use the map to complete the task.

.. code-block:: arduino

    int x = analogRead(knob);
    int y = map(x,0,1023,0,255);
    analogWrite(led,y);


**Notes and Warnings**

* The "lower bound" of both ranges may be larger or smaller than the "upper bound", which means that the ``map()`` function can be used to reverse a range of numbers.

  .. code-block:: arduino

    y = map(x,0,180,180,0);

* Mapping also works well for negative numbers.

  .. code-block:: arduino

    y = map(x,0,1023,-90,90);

* The mapping uses integers, and the decimal places of floats are discarded.
