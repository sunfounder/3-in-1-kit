5.11.2 IR Receiver
=========================

In this project, you will learn to use IR Receiver. 

An infrared-receiver is a component which receives infrared signals and can independently receive infrared rays and output signals compatible with TTL level. 
It is similar with a normal plastic-packaged transistor in size and is suitable for all kinds of infrared remote control and infrared transmission.

**Required Components**

In this project, we need the following components. 

It's definitely convenient to buy a whole kit, here's the link:

**Wiring**

In this example, we wire up the left pin of IR Receiver to pin 11, 
the middle pin to GND, and the right pin to 5V.

**Code**

.. note::

    * Open the ``5.11.ir_receiver.ino`` file under the path of ``3in1-kit\learning_project\5.11.ir_receiver``.
    * Or copy this code into **Arduino IDE**.
    * The ``IRremote`` library is used here, you can install it from the **Library Manager**.

After uploading the codes to the R4 board, you can see that the
current value of the pressed button of IR Remote Controller displays on
the serial monitor.

**How it works?**

This code is designed to work with an infrared (IR) remote control using the ``IRremote`` library. Here's the breakdown:

#. Include Libraries: This includes the ``IRremote`` library, which provides functions to work with IR remote controls.

    .. code-block:: arduino

        #include <IRremote.h>

#. Defines the Arduino pin to which the IR sensor's signal pin is connected.

    .. code-block:: arduino

        const int IR_RECEIVE_PIN = 11;  // Define the pin number for the IR Sensor


#. Initializes serial communication at a baud rate of 9600. Initializes the IR receiver on the specified pin (``IR_RECEIVE_PIN``) and enables LED feedback (if applicable).

    .. code-block:: arduino

        void setup() {
            Serial.begin(9600);                                     // Start serial communication at 9600 baud rate
            IrReceiver.begin(IR_RECEIVE_PIN, ENABLE_LED_FEEDBACK);  // Start the IR receiver
        }

#. The loop runs continuously to process incoming IR remote signals.

    .. code-block:: arduino

        void loop() {
            if (IrReceiver.decode()) {
                String decodedValue = decodeKeyValue(IrReceiver.decodedIRData.command);
                if (decodedValue != "ERROR") {
                    Serial.println(decodedValue);
                    delay(100);
                }
                IrReceiver.resume();  // Enable receiving of the next value
            }
        }
    
    * Checks if an IR signal is received and successfully decoded.
    * Decodes the IR command and stores it in ``decodedValue`` using a custom ``decodeKeyValue()`` function.
    * Checks if the decoded value is not an error.
    * Prints the decoded IR value to the serial monitor.
    * Resumes IR signal reception for the next signal.
