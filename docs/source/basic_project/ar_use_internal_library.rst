5.5 Use Internal Library
=======================================

In the Arduino IDE, you can use many built-in libraries by adding the corresponding ``.h`` file directly to your code.

This project uses the ``Servo`` library to drive the Servo, so that it can rotate between 0Â° and 180Â°.

**Required Components**

In this project, we need the following components. 

It's definitely convenient to buy a whole kit, here's the link:

**Schematic**

In this project, we use PWM pin 9 to drive the Servo, and get the orange
wire of the servo connected to the PWM pin 9, the red one to 5V, and the
brown one to GND.

**Wiring**

**Code**

.. note::

    * Open the ``5.5.use_internal_library.ino`` file under the path of ``3in1-kit\basic_project\5.5.use_internal_library``.
    * Or copy this code into **Arduino IDE**.
    
    * Or upload the code through the `Arduino Web Editor <https://docs.arduino.cc/cloud/web-editor/tutorials/getting-started/getting-started-web-editor>`_.

Once you finish uploading the codes to the R3 board, you can see the servo arm rotating in the range 0Â°~180Â°.

**How it works?**

By calling the library ``Servo.h``, you can drive the servo easily. 

.. code-block:: arduino

    #include <Servo.h> 

Library Functions: 

.. code-block:: arduino

    Servo

Create **Servo** object to control a servo.

.. code-block:: arduino

    uint8_t attach(int pin); 

Call ``pinMode()`` to turn a pin into a servo driver and return 0 on failure.

.. code-block:: arduino

    void detach();

Release a pin from servo driving.

.. code-block:: arduino

    void write(int value); 

Set the angle of the servo in degrees, 0 to 180.

.. code-block:: arduino

    int read();

Return that value set with the last ``write()``.

.. code-block:: arduino

    bool attached(); 

Return 1 if the servo is currently attached.
