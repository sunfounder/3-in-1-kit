3.6 Follow Your Hand 2
==============================

In the :ref:`sh_follow1` project only the ultrasonic module is used, it can only follow your hand forward.

In this project, we use 2 IR obstacle avoidance modules at the same time, so that the car can follow your hand left or right.

Required Components
---------------------

In this project, we need the following components. 

It's definitely convenient to buy a whole kit, here's the link:

Build the Circuit
-----------------------

Connect the ultrasonic module and the two IR obstacle avoidance modules at the same time.

The wiring between the ultrasonic and the R3 board is as follows.

Programming
---------------

The effect to be achieved by this project is as follows

* Ultrasonic detects your hand about 5-10cm in front and let the car follow.
* The infrared module on the left detects your hand and turns to the left.
* The right IR module detects your hand and turns to the right.

**1. Create a block**

Create blocks that allow the car to move forward, turn left, turn right and stop.

**2. Follow to move forward**

Read the ultrasonic value and if your hand is detected at a distance of 5-10cm, then let the car follow.

**3. Follow to turn left and right**

Read the values of the left and right IR modules.

* If the left IR module detects your hand, turn left.
* If the right IR module detects your hand, turn right.
* If neither IR module and ultrasonic module detect your hand, make the car stop.
