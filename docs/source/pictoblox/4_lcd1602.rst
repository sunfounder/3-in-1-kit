LCD1602 can be used to display 2x16 characters, now we let it display the corresponding characters with the character sprites on the stage.

When you click the Hello on the stage one by one, they will have different animation effects and the characters will be displayed on the LCD1602 at the same time.

Now to set different effects for these sprites and display them on the LCD1602 while clicking.

**2. H is zoom in and zoom out**

Click on the **H** sprite, and now write a script for it.

When the sprite **H** is clicked, make its size to 50%, then restore it; while displaying H on the first row and column of the LCD1602.

* [set size to]: From **Looks** palette, used to set the size of the sprite, from 0% to 100%.
* [set cursor at columan row]: From **Display Modules** palette, used to set the cursor at a specific row of the LCD1602 to start displaying characters.
* [write display]: From the **Display Modules** palette, used to display characters or strings on the LCD1602.

Click on the **E** sprite, and now write a script for it.

When the sprite **E** is clicked, have it turn 180 degrees clockwise, then 180 degrees counterclockwise so you can see it flip left and right; and show H in the first row and column 2 of the LCD1602.

* [turn degrees]: From the **Motions** palette, used to turn the sprite clockwise or counterclockwise, the range is 0-360 degrees.
