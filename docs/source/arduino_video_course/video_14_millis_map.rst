Video 14: Understanding millis() and map() in Arduino
========================================================

This tutorial focuses on using millis() for time tracking and map() for value conversion in Arduino, showcasing practical applications like timed button responses and LED brightness control.

* **Millis Functionality**: millis() as a time-keeping function in Arduino, starting from zero at program run and incrementing every millisecond.
* **Timed Events with millis()**: How to utilize millis() for executing events at specific time intervals without halting the entire program, unlike delay().
* **Button Press Timing**: Example of using millis() to detect a button press and execute an action after a set duration.
* **Map Function Introduction**: Introduction to the map() function, which is used for converting numerical values from one range to another.
* **LED Brightness Adjustment**: Practical demonstration of using map() to adjust LED brightness levels by mapping percentage values to the PWM range.
* **Efficient Coding with millis() and map()**: Showcasing efficient Arduino coding practices by combining millis() for non-blocking timing and map() for intuitive value conversion.
