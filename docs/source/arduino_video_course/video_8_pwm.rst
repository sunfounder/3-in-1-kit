Video 8: PWM and Loop Structures
=====================================

This Arduino tutorial delves into the use of PWM for controlling devices like motors and LEDs, along with a comprehensive guide on programming loops such as for, while, and do-while.

* **PWM Fundamentals**: Understanding PWM and duty cycles for controlling device behaviors.
* **Analog Writing with Arduino**: Using `analogWrite` to modulate signal strength for motors and LEDs.
* **For Loop Demonstrations**: Practical examples of for loops for gradual LED fading.
* **While Loop Usage**: Implementing while loops for efficient program execution.
* **Do-While Loop Mechanics**: Exploring the unique structure and applications of do-while loops in Arduino projects.
* **Practical LED Control**: Step-by-step setup and code for adjusting LED brightness using PWM.
