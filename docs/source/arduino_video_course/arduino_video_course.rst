Arduino Video Course
======================

Embark on a journey through the Arduino world with the comprehensive Arduino Video Course, using SunFounder's 3 in 1 starter kit. This series begins with an introduction to the Arduino ecosystem and the capabilities of the uno R3 board, setting the stage for a deep dive into practical applications and programming techniques. You'll learn the basics of controlling LEDs, understanding serial communication, and manipulating various components like RGB LEDs, buttons, and shift registers. The course also offers a variety of fun projects such as smart car projects and IoT projects. As long as you follow the course step by step, you will master Arduino, not just copy and paste code, you will write your own code and implement your Arduino projects the way you like.
