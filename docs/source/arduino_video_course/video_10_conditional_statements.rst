Video 10: Conditional Statements and Arrays
=============================================

Explore the fundamentals of conditional statements and arrays in Arduino, including practical applications in LED control and data management.

* **Conditional Statements**: Learning to use if, else, and else-if statements in Arduino for decision-making.
* **Practical Examples**: Application of conditional logic in scenarios like temperature control and traffic regulation.
* **Arrays in Arduino**: Demonstrating the creation, modification, and usage of arrays to store and manage data.
* **Controlling LEDs with Arrays**: How to use arrays for efficient control of multiple LEDs.
* **Understanding Floats**: Introduction to the float data type and managing precision in numerical operations.
* **Using Loops with Arrays**: Leveraging 'for' loops to iterate over array elements, simplifying code for tasks like LED sequencing.
