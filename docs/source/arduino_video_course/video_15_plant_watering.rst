Video 15: Automating Plant Watering
======================================

This tutorial covers the use of a soil moisture sensor with Arduino to monitor soil wetness and automate watering through code and hardware demonstrations.

* **Soil Moisture Sensor Basics**: Introduction to the soil moisture sensor, its pins, and how it measures soil moisture.
* **Sensor-Arduino Wiring**: Step-by-step instructions on connecting the moisture sensor to the Arduino.
* **Arduino Code for Moisture Reading**: Explanation of Arduino code to read and interpret moisture levels from the sensor.
* **Understanding Sensor Output**: Analysis of the sensor's output values to determine soil moisture conditions.
* **Automated Watering Logic**: Development of an advanced Arduino code to automate watering based on soil moisture levels.
* **Practical Implementation and Testing**: Demonstrations of the sensor in action within soil, showing how the system can trigger a buzzer or control a water pump for automated watering.
