Video 17: Interrupts and LDR for Smart Projects
========================================================

Explore the functionalities of Arduino interrupts and Light-Dependent Resistors (LDRs) to build smart day/night detection projects.

* **Arduino Interrupts Explained**: Delve into the mechanics of Arduino interrupts for more efficient coding.
* **Effective Use of Interrupt Pins**: Learn which Arduino pins support interrupts and how to use them.
* **Practical Interrupt Setup**: Demonstrates setting up a push button and buzzer to work with Arduino interrupts.
* **Introduction to LDRs**: Discover how LDRs change resistance based on light and their applications.
* **LDR Measurement Techniques**: Learn how to measure LDR resistance in various lighting conditions using a multimeter.
* **Day/Night Detection Projects**: Implement LDR-based projects for automatic switching of devices like buzzers or lights based on light intensity.
